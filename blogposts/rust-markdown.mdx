I just finished creating a new program in Rust that I'm excited to share with you all. It took a good amount of hours debugging and trying out different approaches.

The goal of this program is to create a simple web-based Markdown editor that allows you to edit a Markdown file on your local machine using an IDE or text editor, and see a live preview of the rendered HTML in your web browser.

So how does it work? Well, the program is built using the Actix-Web framework, and it utilizes some other Rust libraries for parsing and rendering Markdown (pulldown_cmark). Whenever you save changes to the Markdown file in your IDE or text editor, the program automatically updates the preview in your web browser using a polling mechanism to check for updates and the pulldown_cmark library to render the Markdown into HTML.

Under the hood, the program uses Rust's concurrency primitives to manage shared state between the different parts of the program. It uses a Mutex and an Arc to ensure that the Markdown is always in a consistent state and can be accessed by multiple threads at once.

Overall, I'm really happy with how this program turned out. It was a fun challenge to build, and I learned a lot about Rust and web development along the way. If you're interested in checking it out for yourself, you can check out my repo!
