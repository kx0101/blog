As a beginner in Rust, I found that creating this application was an excellent way to solidify my understanding of fundamental concepts such as enums, structs, modules, crates, traits, functions, ownership and borrowing, error handling, external dependencies and more!

If you're interested in learning Rust, I highly recommend trying out this application as a hands-on way to practice the material you've studied. It's a great way to get some real-world experience with Rust development and build something that you can actually use.

Thanks for reading, and happy coding!
