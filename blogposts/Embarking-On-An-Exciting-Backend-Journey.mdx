Hey there, fellow readers! Today, I want to share with you my exhilarating leap into the fascinating world of backend development. As a frontend engineer, I've spent the past year working on a complex frontend application, where I faced numerous challenges to ensure the integration with our robust backend. However, I recently had a conversation with my manager, and guess what? They agreed to let me dive into the realm of backend development in our awesome project!

This opportunity has ignited a fire within me, and I couldn't be more thrilled to broaden my skill set. I've always been curious about what happens behind the scenes, how data flows, and how complex systems come together to create magical experiences for users.

To prepare for this exciting endeavor, I've been investing my free time wholeheartedly in learning the ropes of backend technologies. I've been devouring knowledge from Udemy courses like a hungry learner. From Java to Spring Boot, PostgreSQL to OpenAPI, and even exploring microservices and Kafka, I've been diving deep in these fascinating technologies.

But it doesn't stop at theoretical understanding! I strongly believe in learning by doing. So, alongside my courses, I've been working on building simple projects, experimenting, and getting my hands dirty. It's been an incredibly rewarding journey so far, and I can't wait to apply my newfound knowledge and skills to our complex application.

Stay tuned, as I document my progress in this thrilling backend exploration. I'll share my learnings, triumphs, and even the occasional stumble along the way.

Remember, with dedication and thirst for knowledge, we can conquer any new domain. Here's to exciting new beginnings! :)

Catch you soon,
Elijah
